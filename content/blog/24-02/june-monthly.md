I’ve been very nostalgic this month! Logged back into Gaia for the first time in two-ish years. I used to spend a lot of time in the freebie and art shop forums. I think I’ve been on Gaia on and off since 2010 maybe? It’s nice to see it still going. There’s nothing else quite like it!!! I really like how many parts of the website have remained untouched for years. The Art Arena is sooo. . . STINKY. Too bad most of the pictures are broken. I don't have anything meaningful to add to the conversation about Gaia's inflation. . .but wooow everything’s so expensive. Who else remembers the days when you could buy a pixel cake slice for like 500g in the mini shops forum??

I checked on [my OCs on Toyhouse](https://toyhou.se/stink), too. I haven’t drawn or thought about ‘em in soooooo long. OMG they stink SOOOO BAD! I updated the CSS on my [main OC booru](https://caraberry.booru.org/index.php). I’ve never messed with it before, actually. I like having a little place to store art of my OCs but I donno how long the service will last. I’d like to self-host something but I don’t trust myself to keep up with maintenance. I could always just upload everything to Toyhouse too but hmmmm.

I’m doing Artfight this year, you can [check out my profile if you want](https://artfight.net/~stink). I wanna do it every year but something always comes up. I’m busy with some Summer courses this time but I thought I’d give it a try anyways. We’ll see how I do this time around!! 

Charli XCX's Brat album came out!!! My fav tracks are Talk Talk and Apple. I've had it on repeat since it came out. Look at [this Slant review of Camila Cabello's new album](https://web.archive.org/web/20240626014512/https://www.slantmagazine.com/music/camila-cabello-cxoxo-album-review/) LOL. I've seen soooo many people hate on her and call her a dork. It's funny. . . Her song that goes I LUV IT I LUV IT I LUUUV ITTTT is really catchy. 

That’s all for now. Check out my gf [chezimu’s website](https://chezimu.neocities.org/)! It’s so cute and so her. She's so so so talented. I’m really happy that she’s sharing her stuff online again!! It’s crazy we used to on Deviantart 24/7 when we were itty bitty babies (teens). It’s nice to share things with the internet again. . .
