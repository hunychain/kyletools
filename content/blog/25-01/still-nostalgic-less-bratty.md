Hi, did you miss me? I've been trying to write this since January but I haven't felt like sitting down and actually doing it. A lot has happened since my last post (about a year ago. . .). A lot has changed since 2024! Life is tough but love makes it all worth it to me. I have my eye on the prize (my gf) and I'll keep working really hard!!!

At the beginning of the year, I wrote a list of ins and outs. We're already halfway through 2025, isn't that crazy? Let's see how my list is going:

---

### Ins
*Minimalism: Throw out old junk and delete useless files.*

Kind of? Not really. I can't think of anything I've thrown out this year LOL. Nothing's coming to mind right now. I really need to clean and donate things I don't need. I've definitely accumulated more stuff this year. I built a PC (in December), I replaced my old laptop, I bought an eInk tablet. . . I'd like to be more intentional with the things I own.

*Gossip: More drama, as a treat.*

LOL This is a random one. My main source of drama and gossip was Twitter and TikTok but I deleted those apps earlier this year! Fun idea but it's impossible to keep up now. I guess that’s a good thing; there are better ways to entertain yourself. :p 

*Creativity: Draw, update this website, etc.*

LOL. . . . I've drawn a little bit here and there. I keep getting the urge to make things but I don't have the motivation. Hopefully that changes. I want to update my site but. . . .! But. . . . . yeaaaahhh {{< emoji skull.gif >}}

*Pixel Art*

I downloaded an app on my iPad and drew ONE little pixel head. 

### Outs

*Self-criticism: Stop being unreasonable!*

Still working at it. Let's all be kinder to ourselves okay {{< emoji sweatdrop.gif >}}

*Procrastination*

I wrote "This year I'm locking in!!!!" and I kinda did. Baby steps LOL. There's a lot I want to do and I can't keep putting it off! aaagghhh!!!!!!!!!!!

*Repression: Let everything out.*

This is a process. I think I'm doing okay here. I've gotten into the habit of writing my feelings down. It helps make sense of things sometimes. Instead of letting thoughts float around my mind I dump them out onto my notes app. I want to be cute and write down happy thoughts too. :)

*Rotting: Stop scrolling for hours.*

I managed to replace scrolling with reading for a while! I deleted TikTok and other apps I tend to waste my time on. It definitely made me more productive. I re-downloaded TikTok like a week ago, though. I've found myself scrolling longer than I should so I should probably get rid of it. But not yet, let me have this. . .

That's my list! I had other stuff written down in my draft from January but it's disorganized, straight up chicken scratch. My lovely beautiful gorgeous girl [mentioned the stuff we watched in 2024 in a blog post (Jan 2025)](https://chezimu.neocities.org/Diary)! My favorite show was *Oniisama e*, the drama was sooooooo GEWD. My favorite movie was probablyyyy *Love Lies Bleeding*! My favorite album was Clairo's *Charm*. <3 And also *Chasing Moving Trains* by Roy Blair. I swear I was waiting for that thing for YEARS, since like 2019.

I think I mentioned Addison Rae in my last post. People were clowning her for being inauthentic. . . Her album *Addison* came out recently and I luvs it. I don't remember what I said about her but I'm excited to see what else she puts out. Speaking of music, I added a [music page with stuff you should listen to](https://kyletools.neocities.org/music/)!
