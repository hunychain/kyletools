Heyyy it's been a while {{< emoji skull >}} I dunno what to say. Crazy how life can change in a year. . . 
In this post: site updates and SmackJeeves nostalgia. (^_^)

Some updates:

- I have a button! Link to it if you wanna.
- 123guestbook is shutting down, so I made [a new guestbook](https://kyle.atabook.org/). Thanks to everyone who’s left a comment!!
- New fonts! I liked the simplicity of using the defaults, but I like the new vibe these bitmap fonts bring.
- [Source code is on GitHub](https://github.com/hunychain/kyletools) now; updating the site is easier. Feel free to take a look and copy it. It's a mess though, I'm still learning :P

Here’s something from my drafts:

I binged some Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha. Love those girls so much. YURI POWER!! Precia's greatest crime was covering her catgirl familiar’s ears with a hat. . .

Look at this cute baby pic:

By this point you’re probably wondering what the title is all about!!! This is a memory I dug up after browsing Neocities and seeing the usual “no hotlinking” reminders.

Back in the [SmackJeeves](https://tropedia.fandom.com/wiki/Smack_Jeeves) era (early 2010s for me) you could link to an image as your profile picture. I hotlinked a picture I found (don’t remember what it was) and it worked, everything normal. Years later I logged back into my account and my pfp had changed to a gif Goatse & Suiseiseki from Rozen Maiden telling me not to hotlink. It was SO SHOCKING to see out of nowhere. I don’t know how long that pfp was up but I was surprised my account hadn’t been suspended or something. I don’t know how they detected my hotlinking. I’m so curious (but not curious to look it up right now LOL).

Speaking of SmackJeeves, I miss it!!! I loved reading South Park ({{< emoji embarrassed >}}) yaoi on there as a kid. So much BL in general. It made people sooo mad to see BL on the front page back then. I might make a post about my old SJ favs one day. . . I don't keep up with any webtoons so I don't know what's popular these days. I hope the girls are still fujoing out!

Before SJ went down I downloaded my childhood fav, “Stupid Hat”. My South Park yaoi keepsake!!
