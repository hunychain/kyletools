This website was coded by me with the help of the following tools:

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) - A static site generator. You can [read about my experience with it](/blog/23-01/kyle-makes-kyle-tools#using-hugo).
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - My IDE! Sometimes I use [vim](https://www.vim.org/) for quick edits.
- The only pages that use scripts are the  homepage (status/spotify widgets) and gallery. If you have Javascript disabled, the gallery should still work. I'm using [Lightbox2](https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2).
- I've been experimenting with different tools to optimize my images. I use a combination of:
  - [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac) & [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) - To reduce image file sizes.
  - [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) - To edit multiple images at once.
  - [Gifsicle](https://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/) - to optimize gifs.
- [git](https://git-scm.com/) - Version control to keep track of changes.
- [Neocities CLI](https://neocities.org/cli) - To push updates!
- [Hackneyed cursors](https://gitlab.com/Enthymeme/hackneyed-x11-cursors)
- [Mutant Standard emojis](https://mutant.tech/)! {{< emoji v >}}

Feel free to inspect the site and copy/take inspiration/whatever. My code is a mess right now, though...
